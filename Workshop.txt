description=[h2]How does it work?[/h2][list]
description=[*] A new option, "Mow the lawn", appears in the context menu when you have a scythe in your inventory. The scythe’s regular behavior remains unchanged: you can still create farmland.
description=[*] Use the rotate key to change the cursor size: 3x3, 2x2, or 1x1 (just like with regular scythe use, in case you didn’t know).
description=[*] The time required depends on the number of grass tufts to cut.
description=[*] Also works with the hand scythe, but the cursor size is limited to 1x1 (still way faster than doing it all by hand).
